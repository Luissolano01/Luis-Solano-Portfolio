		</ul>
	</div>
	

		<h2>Wireframes</h2>
		
		
		<div class="wireframes">
		
		<p> Here we can see the sketches for the Home page. Since the landing page linked to different pages, 
			it was important to take into account information hierarchy. Content placement that would optimize engagement,
			branding, and marketing was taken into account.
		</p>

		<!--
		<div class="set">-->	
		<img src = "imgs/wireframe1.jpg"  alt = "first wireframe"/>
		<img src = "imgs/wireframe2.jpg"  alt = "second wireframe"/>
		<img src = "imgs/wireframe4.jpg"  alt = "third wireframe"/>
		<!--</div>-->
		

		<p> The following section focuses primarily on the Media page. Keeping the design clean and modern looking was priority. 
			Because this page would link to social media accounts, podcasts, and highlights of previous events, it was crucial that there
			were no barriers for the user.
		</p>
		<img src = "imgs/wireframe6.jpg"  alt = "seventh wireframe"/>
		<img src = "imgs/wireframe5.jpg"  alt = "fifth wireframe"/>
		<img src = "imgs/wireframe10.jpg" alt = "sixth wireframe"/>

		<p> Highlighting when the next events were taking place was a key aspect for the evnts page. We wanted to maximize engagement and minimize
			hassle of putting that event on someone's calendar. Moreover, it was also important to eggectively, yet concisely present more 
			information about such events.  
		</p>
		<img src = "imgs/wireframe3.jpg"  alt = "fourth wireframe"/>
		<!--<img src = "imgs/wireframe7.jpg"  alt = "eighth wireframe"/>-->
		<img src = "imgs/wireframe8.jpg"  alt = "ninth wireframe"/>
		
		<p> The About page mainly served for the user to see a face to the project; therefore, it was crucial to make it easy
			for the user to know who the team was, why they were pursuing this project, and they can get innvolved or in touch. 
		</p>
		<img src = "imgs/wireframe9.jpg"  alt = "tenth wireframe"/>
		<img src = "imgs/wireframe11.jpg" alt = "eleventh wireframe"/>
		</div>

		
		<h2>Design Application</h2>
		<div class="designs">
		
		<p> Having multiple iteration sketches for the About page, the implementation of the website ended up looking very similar
			to the wireframe sketches. A change that was made to the About page was that our Home page now incorporated our mission
			and vision statement. The main reason for this was to make it more visible to users as they opened the website. 
		</p>
		<img src = "imgs/design1.png" width="1000" alt = "first implementation"/>
		<img src = "imgs/design2.PNG" width="1000" alt = "second implementation"/>
		<img src = "imgs/design3.PNG" width="1000" alt = "third implementation"/>

		<p>
			Adding an opportunity for users to become allies, the Home page included a description of events and services where the 
			user will be able learn more and click and sign up as an ally to get access to further information. This served as a funnel
			to grow the Maximize network.
		</p>
		<img src = "imgs/design4.PNG" width="1000" alt = "fourth implementation"/>
		<img src = "imgs/design5.PNG" width="1000" alt = "fifth implementation"/>
		</div>	
		
		
		<h2>Final Takeaways</h2
		><div class="wrap_up">
		<p>
			The intention of this website was for current and potential Maximize Allies to get a better understanding of what products
			and services Maximize has to offer. Aiming to create a quality experience, another objective of the site is to allow Maximize
			Allies to interact with the rest of the alliance; therefore, validating our design decisions with user testing is going to be 
			a key step that will determine what updates and improvements will be made in the near future.
		</p>
		</div>

		<h2>Reflection</h2>
		<div class="reflection">
		<p>
			Overall, I really enjoyed learning about the design process and getting more experience by preparing to launch a website. Taking
			the perspective of a new user that may not know about Maximize and designing the site around creating a quality and smooth 
			experience really taught me more about how individuals think when they interact with technology.
			Moreover, while using information hierarchy and creating wireframe sketches, I found that it became easier to visualize the steps a user would
	 		think about, which was more beneficial rather than just jumping into the implementation of the website.
			Thinking back to sites Iâ€™ve visited in the past, I really wanted to make sure that information was clear for the user and 
			they did not have to spend time going back and forth to see the full picture of the services offered. Focusing on this and keeping 
			a modern feel, we were satisfied with launching the first design for the website.
