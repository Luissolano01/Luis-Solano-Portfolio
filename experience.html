	<h1>Experience</h1>
	
	<div class="skills">
	<p> I have had previous experience working with CSS, where I was able to help develop and design a music guessing game. 
		Currently, I am developing my skills in python, CSS, and HTML. My focus is on the UI/UX side of things and figuring out the best 
		approach to tackle a problem using data. I'm also expanding my knowledge in different types of investment opportuinities including stocks,
		trading currencies, and tapping into the blockchain world. 
	</p>
	</div>

	<div class="skills2">
	<p>
		One of my most recent experiences was being part of the core team for an accelerator
		type startup, where my main focuses were in the UI/UX and branding & marketing team.
		Here, I was able to develop crucial skills that not only help in designing and branding, 
		but also skills that optimize leadership, communication, strategizing, team building and 
		many more skills that can help propel a project forward. Moreover, I am part of an organization
		that has hosted multiple events, panels, & workshops throughout the year here on campus. Through
		this, I have continued to develop skills in event planning, organization, and time management
	</p>
	</div>

	<div class="skills3">
	<p>I am developing and working to implement my sustainability initiative, Bambu. With this, I have
		furthered my understanding in starting a project and making it a reality. Through this I have developed and refined my skillsets
		in community discovery, affinity mapping, user testing, iteration, business development, organizational skills, branding, wireframing and much more. 
		Moreover, I have also had the opportunity to be a part of the Dare to Dream program at ZLI and optiMize, which have helped me
		connect with mentors, create a budget, prototyping and other crucial skills for project management.
